# mrudul-website

My personal website developed using Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI deployed on Vercel! 

Check it out at mrudulsuresh.com!

I had no idea how to get started initially, but throughout my time at Groovever, I found that I had gained a whole lot of knowledge in front end dev! If you're in a similar position, feel free to check out my video on front-end dev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN6b0BrA_c

is a fun and clear video I made that serves as the perfect guide to start learning and working on front end! When I first started, I remember how lost I felt and didn't know where to start at all. So to help others that are in that same position, I made this video to try and hopefully help!

Feel free to contact me about anything!
