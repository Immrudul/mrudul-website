# mrudul-website

My personal website developed using Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI deployed on Vercel! 

Check it out at https://mrudulsuresh.com

I initially had no idea how to even get started on front-end dev, but through a whole bunch of trial and error while working at Groovever, I found myself in a comfortable enough position to create my own website! 

For anyone that feels like they may be just as lost I was when I was starting, here's a fun and clear video I made that serves as the perfect guide to start learning and working on front end! When I first started, I remember how lost I felt and to help others that are in that same position, I made this video to try and hopefully help!
